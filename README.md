## What It Does

Open Razer macOS gives you native macOS control over your Razer peripherals without Razer Synapse. The **battery menu bar app** lives in your menu bar and keeps you informed about your wireless mouse's charge level with color-coded icons and smart polling. The **RGB control GUI** lets you set lighting effects on mice and keyboards.

---

## Battery Menu Bar App

The star of the show. A lightweight [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps)-based menu bar app that monitors your wireless Razer mouse battery.

### Install the Standalone App (Recommended)

1. Download **`Razer-Battery-v1.0.0-macOS.zip`** from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Extract and drag **Razer Battery.app** to `/Applications`
3. Right-click the app > **Open** (required first time for unsigned apps)
4. Optional: Add to **System Settings > General > Login Items** for auto-start

### Battery States

The menu bar icon changes color and shape based on your battery level:

| State | Battery | Icon | Color | Description |
|-------|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Critical** | 0 -- 10% | Single partial segment | Red | Time to charge immediately |
| **Low** | 11 -- 30% | One full segment | Orange | Charge soon |
| **Medium** | 31 -- 60% | Two segments | Orange + Yellow-Green | Comfortable range |
| **Full** | 61 -- 100% | Three segments | Green | Fully operational |
| **Charging** (low) | Any, charging <=30% | Lightning bolt | Orange bolt | Plugged in, still low |
| **Charging** (high) | Any, charging >30% | Lightning bolt | Green + White bolt | Plugged in, charging well |
| **Disconnected** | -- | Empty outline | Gray | Mouse not found |

### Smart Polling

- **Normal**: Checks battery every 5 minutes (configurable: 1, 5, 10, or 15 min)
- **Disconnected**: Switches to fast 30-second polling until your mouse reconnects
- **Wake**: Waits 2 seconds after sleep/wake for USB re-enumeration, then refreshes
- **Staleness guard**: Forces a re-scan if no successful read in 10+ minutes

### Settings

Configurable from the menu bar dropdown. Settings persist to `~/.config/razer-battery/settings.json`.

| Setting | Default | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Poll interval | 5 min | 1, 5, 10, 15 minutes |
| Low battery threshold | 20% | 10%, 15%, 20% |
| Low battery notification | On | On / Off |
| Display mode | Icon + % | Icon + %, % only, Icon only |
| Launch at login | Off | On / Off |

---

## RGB Control GUI

A PyQt5 interface for setting LED effects on Razer mice and keyboards.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

**Supported effects**: Static color, Breathing, Wave, Reactive

Each effect has configurable parameters (color, speed, direction) through an intuitive tabbed interface.

---

## Quick Start (From Source)

### Prerequisites

> **Important**: Razer's DriverKit extensions claim exclusive HID access. Uninstall them first:
> ```bash
> sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall R2H967U7J8 com.razer.appengine.driver
> sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall R2H967U7J8 com.razer.appengine.virtual.driver
> ```

- macOS (tested on recent versions)
- Python 3.8+
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

### Setup

```bash
# Install system dependency
brew install hidapi

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ForestApps/OpenMacOSRazer.git
cd OpenMacOSRazer

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

```bash
# Battery menu bar app
python3 razer_battery_tray.py

# RGB control GUI
python3 main.py
```

> **Note**: Grant **Input Monitoring** permission to your terminal in **System Settings > Privacy & Security** if you encounter HID access errors.

## How It Works

```
                    +------------------+
                    |   Menu Bar App   |
                    |  (rumps / PyQt5) |
                    +--------+---------+
                             |
                    +--------v---------+
                    |   razer_common   |
                    |  Protocol Layer  |
                    +--------+---------+
                             |
                    +--------v---------+
                    |      hidapi      |
                    |  HID over USB    |
                    +--------+---------+
                             |
                    +--------v---------+
                    |   Razer Device   |
                    |   (VID: 0x1532)  |
                    +------------------+
```

**Protocol**: 90-byte HID feature reports with CRC validation. Battery queries use command class `0x07` with per-device transaction IDs. Responses are validated, retried across interfaces on failure, and converted from raw 0-255 values to 0-100% percentages.

**Error Recovery**: Exponential backoff on repeated failures, per-interface retry logic, and interface preference tracking that remembers the last working interface.

## How the Battery Indicator Works: A Comic Guide

*Inspired by Bob's Burgers -- because batteries deserve a good pun too.*

## Troubleshooting

**Menu bar shows a warning icon instead of battery percentage?**

1. **Remove Razer drivers** -- they claim exclusive HID access:
   ```bash
   sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall R2H967U7J8 com.razer.appengine.driver
   sudo systemextensionsctl uninstall R2H967U7J8 com.razer.appengine.virtual.driver
   ```
2. **Enable Input Monitoring**: System Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring > enable Razer Battery
3. **Relaunch** the app
4. **Check logs**: `~/Library/Logs/razer-battery-tray.log` for `open failed` HID errors
